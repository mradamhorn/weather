# WeatherBee

## Description

Here is a simple weather app I developed as a coding student as I was learning to use APIs. I used Bootstrap for much of the HTML and style code. It pulls data from the "Current Weather Data" API and the "One Call API" available on [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api). 

The information produced is for current weather and a 5-day forecast for locations entered into the text input field. 

Current Weather returns current information on temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index. 

The 5-day forecast produces information on the forecasted day's temperature, the forecasted low temperature, the forecasted maximum temperature, and the forecasted humidity for the next five days. 

Note: As of 2/5/2021, version uploaded is most ideal for use in a web brower. I have not had time to improve use for mobile devices.
